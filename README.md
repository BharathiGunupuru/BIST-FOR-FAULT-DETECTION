# BIST-FOR-FAULT-DETECTION
The Built-In Self-Test (BIST) implementation for fault detection in VLSI circuits focuses on integrating self-testing mechanisms within the circuit design. This approach helps detect faults, enhance reliability, and reduce dependency on external test equipment. It is applied to a 4-bit ALU, enabling automated in-circuit testing.
