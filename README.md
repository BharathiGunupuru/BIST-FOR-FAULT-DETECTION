# BIST-FOR-FAULT-DETECTION
The Built-In Self-Test (BIST) implementation for fault detection in VLSI circuits focuses on integrating self-testing mechanisms within the circuit design. This approach helps detect faults, enhance reliability, and reduce dependency on external test equipment. It is applied to a 4-bit ALU, enabling automated in-circuit testing.
That sounds like a fascinating and challenging project! Built-In Self-Test (BIST) is a crucial technique for fault detection in VLSI circuits, and implementing it requires a good understanding of digital design, testability, and fault modeling. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started and make progress on your project

 # Key Components of BIST:**
     - **Test Pattern Generator (TPG):** Generates test vectors to stimulate the circuit.
     - **Circuit Under Test (CUT):** The actual logic circuit being tested.
     - **Output Response Analyzer (ORA):** Compares the output of the CUT with expected results to detect faults.
     
   - **Types of BIST:**
     - **Logic BIST (LBIST):** Used for testing random logic circuits.
     - **Memory BIST (MBIST):** Used for testing embedded memories.

# Need for Fault Detection in VLSI
 VLSI circuits are prone to manufacturing defects and operational failures.
Traditional Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) is costly and slow.
BIST enables real-time, on-chip fault detection.
